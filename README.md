# Modern React with Redux [2020]

**A Repository for all projects I've made following along and working with the 'Modern React with Redux [2020 Update]' course by Stephen Grider.  I will be creating files along with the course and coding along, likely adding my own code as well to test myself and experiment with concepts.  

*The point of taking this course is to work on my mastery with React while I am on a temporary break from school (Lambda).  It's the goal to finish the majority of the course within the allotted week-and-a-half break we are given for school.  The primary focus for me is to become more comfortable with Redux, but also to touch up on my other React-based skills.
